    <!--Using the foreach loop on page 261 as an example build a separate
    row for each Trip object in the Model collection.
    Each row should contain five cells.
    Thus, your code, like that on page 261, should have a single
    set of <tr> tags and five sets of <td> tags.
    The first cell should contain the Destination.
    The second cell should contain the Start Date.
    Hint: use ToShortDateString() to convert to a legible string.
    Note also that StartDate can be null, so use the ? operator.
    The third cell should contain the End Date.
    Hint: use the same formatting as for Start Date mentioned above.
    The fourth cell should use IsNullOrEmpty in an if statement
    to see if Accommodation is populated. (see page 233)
    If it is:
        i. Place it in a <div> tag within the cell
        ii. Also test if AccommodationPhone and AccommodationEmail
            are populated and, if so, place each in a <div> tag within the same cell
    The fifth cell should contain ThingToDo1, ThingToDo2, and ThingToDo3, each in
    its own <div> tag within the cell, but only if each is populated.
